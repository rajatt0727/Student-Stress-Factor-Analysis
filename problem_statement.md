# Student Stress Factor Analysis - Problem Statement

## Project Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze the key factors contributing to stress among students based on a dataset of 1,100 students. The analysis focuses on identifying correlations between various psychological, physiological, environmental, academic, and social factors, and how these factors influence student stress levels.

## Questions to Address:

### Descriptive Statistics:
1. **How many students are in the dataset?**
2. **What is the average anxiety level of students in the dataset?**

### Psychological Factors:
1. **How many students have a self-esteem level below the average?**
2. **What percentage of students have reported experiencing depression?**

### Physiological Factors:
1. **How many students experience headaches frequently?**
2. **How many students rate their sleep quality as poor?**

### Environmental Factors:
1. **How many students live in conditions with high noise levels?**
2. **How many students have reported not having their basic needs met?**

### Academic Factors:
1. **How many students rate their academic performance as below average?**
2. **What is the average study load reported by students?**

### Social Factors:
1. **What percentage of students have experienced bullying?**
2. **How many students participate in extracurricular activities?**

### Comparative Analysis:
1. **Is there a correlation between anxiety levels and academic performance?**
2. **Do students with poor sleep quality also report higher levels of depression?**
3. **Are students who experience bullying more likely to have a history of mental health issues?**

### General Exploration:
1. **Which factor (psychological, physiological, environmental, academic, social) has the highest number of students reporting negative experiences or conditions?**
2. **Which specific feature within each factor has the most significant impact on student stress, based on the dataset?**
